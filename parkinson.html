  <font size="5"><p>    "abstract": "The study was carried out electrophysiological effects of hydrocortisone for protection on the prelimbic cortex (PrL) neurons in rats, particularly in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Caudate-Putamen nuclear complex (CPu) on the models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The study involved 19 rats of the Albino line, each weighing 250 gr. The rats were divided into three experimental groups: intact, rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and rats with PD but treated with hydrocortisone for protection. Extracellular recording was conducted to measure the impulse activity of single neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) particularly in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Caudate-Putamen nuclear complex (CPu) on the models of PD and PD treated with hydrocortisone for protection. In rats with the PD model, there was a decrease in post-stimulus synaptic depressor tetanic effects compared to the norm. This means that the ability of synapses to depress their activity after stimulation was reduced in PD. Conversely, excitatory effects increased in PD rats compared to the norm. This indicates an increase in the excitatory response of neurons in the PD model. When hydrocortisone was applied in PD rats, the frequency of impulse activity dropped sharply, even falling below the levels observed in the normal condition. This indicates that hydrocortisone treatment mitigated the heightened neural activity induced by PD, possibly returning it to a more normal state. Overall, these findings suggest that PD alters synaptic responses and neural activity in the PrL, and hydrocortisone treatment seems to reverse some of these effects.",

Despite these technological advances, the demand for and attitudes toward remote programming compared with standard programming among patients with Parkinson disease are still not well understood.\nThis study aims to investigate the preferences and perceptions associated with these 2 programming methods among patients with Parkinson disease through a web-based survey.\nA web-based survey was administered to 463 patients with Parkinson disease who have undergone DBS surgery. The survey aimed to assess the burdens associated with postoperative programming and to compare patients' attitudes toward the 2 different programming methods.\nA total of 225 patients completed the survey, all of whom had undergone standard programming, while 132 patients had also experienced remote programming. Among those who received standard programming, 191 (85%) patients required the support of more than 1 caregiver, 129 (58%) patients experienced over 2 days of lost work time, 98 (42%) patients incurred expenses ranging from US $42 to US $146, and 14 (6%) patients spent over US $421. Of the 132 patients who had used remote programming, 81 (62%) patients indicated a preference for remote programming in the future. However, challenges with remote programming persisted, including difficulties in obtaining official prescriptions, a lack of medical insurance coverage, and limited medical resources.\nPostoperative programming of DBS imposes significant burdens on patients and their caregivers during standard programming sessions-burdens that could be mitigated through remote programming. While patient satisfaction with remote programming is high, it is imperative for clinicians to develop personalized programming strategies tailored to the needs of different patients.", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cause damage and gradual loss of neurons affecting the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases are most commonly seen in the ageing process. Ageing causes increased reactive oxygen species and decreased mitochondrial ATP generation, resulting in redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress-generated free radicals cause damage to membrane lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to the formation of toxic lipid aldehyde products such as 4- hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde. Several studies have shown that lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde products form adducts with cellular proteins, altering their structure and function. Thus, these lipid aldehydes could act as secondary signaling intermediates, modifying important metabolic pathways, and contributing to the pathophysiology of several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, they could serve as biomarkers for disease progression. This narrative review article discusses the biological and clinical significance of oxidative stress-mediated lipid peroxidation-derived lipid aldehydes in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases.", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "This study explores the complex link between vitamin D and neurological illnesses, focusing on how vitamin D affects possible risk factors, therapeutic applications, and the trajectory of the disease. An epidemiological study has linked vitamin D insufficiency to several neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D contribute to its neuroprotective effects. Two major mechanisms in dementia include neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Adequate levels of vitamin D have been shown in both animal models and human studies to enhance both clinical outcomes and the duration of illness in those who have it. Other ways that vitamin D contributes to its therapeutic potential include the production of neurotrophic factors, control over neurotransmitter synthesis, and preservation of the blood-brain barrier. Despite the encouraging outcomes, research is still being conducted to determine the optimal dosage and long-term benefits of vitamin D supplementation on brain function. In order to furnish precise directives and clarify the processes behind the neuroprotective impacts of vitamin D, future research must focus on large-scale randomized controlled studies. . This study highlights the significance of maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor for neurological disorders. Further study is also required to comprehend the possible medical benefits of this vitamin fully.", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify and analyze factors associated with a higher risk of 3-year mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) within a Romanian cohort, focusing on individuals with more advanced disease stages as indicated by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study on 42 patients with PD treated at the Neurology Clinic I, Cluj-Napoca County Emergency Clinical Hospital, between October 2019 and January 2021. All participants were at stages 2.5 or 3 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale at baseline. Various clinical, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological assessments were performed, including evaluations for motor and non-motor symptoms such as anhedonia (via the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale - SHAPS) and cognitive impairment. The use of antiparkinsonian medications and antidepressants was also recorded. Factors associated with higher mortality risk included a higher anhedonia score (SHAPS > 34; ", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) plays a pivotal role in the deamination process of monoamines, encompassing crucial neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. The heightened interest in MAO-B inhibitors emerged after the revelation that this enzyme could potentially catalyze the formation of neurotoxic compounds from endogenous and exogenous sources. Computational screening methodologies serve as valuable tools in the quest for novel inhibitors, enhancing the efficiency of this pursuit. In this study, 43 acefylline derivatives were docked against the MAO-B enzyme for their chemotherapeutic potential and binding affinities that yielded GOLD fitness scores ranging from 33.21 to 75.22. Among them, five acefylline derivatives, namely, ", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affect millions and present significant challenges in healthcare and treatment costs. The debate in the field pivots around two hypotheses: synaptic spread and selective vulnerability. Pioneers like Virginia Lee and John Trojanowski have been instrumental in identifying key proteins (tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43) central to these diseases. The synaptic spread hypothesis suggests a cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic proteins across neuronal synapses, influencing disease progression, with studies highlighting the role of proteins like alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in this process. In contrast, the selective vulnerability hypothesis proposes inherent susceptibility of certain neurons to degeneration due to factors like metabolic stress, leading to protein aggregation. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, especially PET/MRI hybrid imaging, offer new insights into these mechanisms. While both hypotheses offer substantial evidence, their relative contributions to neurodegenerative processes remain to be fully elucidated. This uncertainty underscores the necessity for continued research, with a focus on these hypotheses, to develop effective treatments for these devastating diseases.", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "Barriers to communication and inaccurate provider assumptions about patient priorities limit the delivery of comprehensive, high-quality, patient-centered care (PCC) to people with Parkinson's (PWP). This study aimed to analyze priorities of PWP using a qualitative, unstructured single-question survey and to test associations with validated quality of life (QOL) measures.\nDuring appointments at a subspecialty, interdisciplinary clinic, PWP (n=139) provided written responses to the prompt: \"What is important for your care team to know about you?\" Patient Health Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Hoehn and Yahr scales were obtained through retrospective chart review. Key qualitative themes were identified through grounded theory analysis, and associations with quantitative health measures were tested with correlation analyses.\nCommon themes included participant health (eg, PD-related goals and comorbidities), non-illness identities (eg, family or community role), and the psychosocial impact of PD (eg, losing independence and uncertainty). Positive sentiments (n=73), such as motivation and optimism, were more common than negative sentiments (n=45), such as loss and fear. There was moderate concordance between worsened mental health and uncertainty (rho=0.206, p=0.02) and inverse concordance between worsened mobility and gratitude (rho=-0.174, p=0.04).\nThe range of priorities that PWP want to share with their care team is more diverse than that of common provider assumptions, is correlated with clinical outcomes such as mental health and mobility, and may not be captured by existing QOL assessment tools. An open-ended, qualitative prompt should be incorporated into routine specialist care for PWP as a valuable QOL indicator.", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Nutritional alterations are one of the non-motor symptoms that most influence the quality of life (QoL) in PD.\nTherefore, this review aims to evaluate whether nutritional alterations are related either to the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms through the gut-brain axis or to the different treatments for PD and whether all of this, in turn, impacts the QoL of patients.\nA systematic review was carried out in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, and Mendeley from 2000 to June 2024, searching for articles related to nutritional alterations in PD that alter patients' QoL. A total of 14 articles (2,187 participants) of 924 records were included.\nAmong the 14 studies examined, two investigated the relationship between nutritional status and QoL in patients with PD. Poor nutritional status was associated with lower QoL scores. Four studies explored the connection between nutritional status and its impact on both motor and non-motor symptoms (psychiatric disturbances, cognitive impairment, and fatigue), revealing a link between nutritional status, activities of daily living, and the severity of motor symptoms. Three studies identified changes in body weight associated with the severity of symptoms related to mobility issues in PD patients. Three studies investigated the relationship between different PD treatments and their interaction with changes in weight and energy metabolism, highlighting that weight loss in the early stages of PD needs adequate monitoring of different treatments, as well as the interaction between the central and peripheral nervous systems in regulating these processes. Finally, two studies investigated how gastrointestinal alterations and changes in the microbiota were related to cognitive status, thus identifying them as risk factors and early signs of PD.\nThe systematic review highlighted the significant relationship between nutritional status and QoL in patients with PD, as well as how the PD treatments influenced their weight. An association was also observed in the gut-brain axis, where adequate nutritional status influenced the balance of intestinal microbiota, slowing cognitive decline, improving activities of daily living, and the QoL of PD patients. It is confirmed that the nutritional status of patients influenced both motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease, and therefore their QoL.", 
</p><p>    "abstract": "Protein aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) is a genetic and neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that variation of \u03b1S aggregation depends on the genetic background. However, which genes and genetic modifiers underlie individual differences in \u03b1S pathology remains unknown. To study the genotypic-phenotypic relationship of \u03b1S aggregation, we constructed a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) panel derived from a cross between genetically divergent strains C. elegans NL5901 and SCH4856, both harboring the human \u03b1S gene. As a first step to discover genetic modifiers 70 \u03b1S-RILs were measured for whole-genome gene expression and expression quantitative locus analysis (eQTL) were mapped. We detected multiple eQTL hot-spots, many of which were located on Chromosome V. To confirm a causal locus, we developed Introgression Lines (ILs) that contain SCH4856 introgressions on Chromosome V in an NL5901 background. We detected 74 genes with an interactive effect between \u03b1S and the genetic background, including the human p38 MAPK homologue pmk-1 that has previously been associated with PD. Together, we present a unique \u03b1S-RIL panel for defining effects of natural genetic variation on \u03b1S pathology, which contributes to finding genetic modifiers of PD.",
